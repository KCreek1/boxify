# BOXIFY

A shared core library powering multiple music streaming applications (Weezify, RiverTunes, and more?).

## Overview
Boxify serves as the foundation for our family of music streaming apps. The core functionality is centralized here, making it easier to maintain consistency across all applications.

## Structure
- The main functionality is located in the `lib/` directory
- When developing for specific apps (like Weezify), you'll primarily work with code in this directory
- Any changes made here will affect all dependent applications

## Getting Started
For detailed setup and usage instructions, please refer to:
- Primary documentation: [`example/`](example) directory
- Development guide: [`example/README.md`](example/README.md)

## Contributing
If you're interested in contributing or running Boxify locally:
1. Check out the documentation in [`example/README.md`](example/README.md)
2. Follow the setup instructions provided there
3. Make your changes in the appropriate `lib/` subdirectory
